# Todo Web Application

A full-stack Todo web application built as part of the Oscowl Co. assignment. This application allows users to manage their daily tasks, authenticate using JWT, and manage their profiles. Users can perform CRUD operations on tasks, update the status of tasks, and update their profile details.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: 
  - Signup and Login with JWT-based authentication.
  - Secure the API routes for authenticated users only.

- **Todo Management**:
  - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing tasks.
  - Ability to update task status (e.g., "Pending", "In Progress", "Completed", "Done").

- **Profile Management**:
  - Users can update their profile information such as name, email, and password.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: 
  - ReactJS (for building the user interface).
  - Axios (for making API requests).
  - React Context (for managing state).

- **Backend**: 
  - Node.js (runtime environment).
  - Express.js (framework for building the backend API).
  - SQLite3 or MongoDB (for database management).
  - JWT (for authentication).
  - UUID (for generating unique task IDs).
